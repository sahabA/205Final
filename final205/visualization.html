            <p class="lead">An analyses of data for Salaries for government employees of San Fransico showed that their women employees earn, on average, 84 cents for every dollar earned by men. Nationally, in 2014 women earned about 79 cents for every dollar earned by men. This pay gap exist in nearly every occupation.
Even though, statistical analysis of available data gives a detailed understanding of this gap, the issue has been widely debated. The right wing policy makers and activists have called this gap a myth. While, AAUW’s The Simple Truth about the Gender Pay Gap addresses these in their very detailed report, we uses data visualization as a tool to show some of these apparent gaps, and debunk the widely misrepresented reasons to call gender pay gap a myth.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"><blockquote><em>
			
			“Full-time employment is technically defined as more than 35 hours. This raises an obvious problem: A simple side-by-side comparison of all men and all women includes people who work 35 hours a week, and others who work 45. Men are significantly more likely than women to work longer hours.”  – WSJ</em></blockquote>
			</p><br/><br/>
			<p class="lead">
			It is true that in many departments, men are making more money in overtime, but it is impossible to tell from the available data if their hourly rate is same as women and they are truly putting in more hours than women in similar jobs as theirs.</p><p class="lead">
			Nonetheless, women are also being discriminated on their base salaries, which can be seen here and in our next visualizations .

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"><blockquote><em>
			“Career choice is another factor. Research in 2013 by Anthony Carnevale, a Georgetown University economist, shows that women flock to college majors that lead to lower-paying careers. Of the 10 lowest-paying majors—such as “drama and theater arts” and “counseling psychology”—only one, “theology and religious vocations,” is majority male.
Conversely, of the 10 highest-paying majors—including “mathematics and computer science” and “petroleum engineering”—only one, “pharmacy sciences and administration,” is majority female. Eight of the remaining nine are more than 70% male.” – WSJ</em></blockquote>

Those numbers do not reflect the number of proportion of men and women in each department and job titles in San Francisco government employment pool.
 The following visualization shows the scatter pot for average base salary and overtime pay for full time employees for each department. The size of the bubble show the percentage of employees in each gender with respect to their department. For spotting patterns visually, male employees are donated by a blue outline, whereas female employees are donated by red outline of the data points.

			<blockquote><em>“[..] women remain more concentrated than men in lower-paying industries and occupations. They work disproportionately as health-care aides, receptionists, cashiers and food servers. This drags down women’s average wages. The second big difference is that women still have slightly less on-the-job experience than men. This, too, lowers their average wages.” -Washington Post</em> </blockquote></p><br/><p class="lead">
